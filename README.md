<center><strong>EMPOWERING FANDOM TO BUILD <em>AWESOME</em> THINGS (WITH CODE)</strong></center>

This repo is for the Fandom Coders group website, wiki, and blog. Fandom Coders
is a community where tech professionals and coding hobbyists alike can share and
discuss their coding projects, find help getting started or unblocked, and learn
new skills and concepts. Among others goals, Fandom Coders aims to increase
coding literacy in fandom and to connect fandom builders with each other to
create and shape the fandom internet they want to see.
